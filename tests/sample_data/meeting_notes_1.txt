Meeting on Q4 Audit Planning - January 15, 2026

Present: Sarah Chen (Head of Audit), Jean-Pierre Dubois (Senior Auditor),
Li Wei (Data Analytics Lead), Rahul Sharma (Risk Manager)

Sarah opened by reviewing the Q3 audit findings. She noted three critical
issues were found in the APAC trade reconciliation system, specifically
around timestamp mismatches between the Hong Kong and Singapore offices.
She wants Q4 to focus on the same area with an expanded scope covering
all five APAC offices.

Jean-Pierre suggested implementing automated data validation checks that
could catch these discrepancies in real-time. He volunteered to draft a
proposal for the automated checks by January 22nd. Sarah agreed this
should be high priority.

Li Wei demonstrated a prototype Power BI dashboard that could monitor
reconciliation anomalies in real-time. The team was impressed with the
demo. Li Wei will schedule a full walkthrough session for the broader
audit team next Thursday at 2pm.

Rahul raised concerns about the regulatory deadline in March. The HKMA
expects a comprehensive report on reconciliation controls by March 31.
The team agreed this is the top priority and needs weekly status updates.
Sarah will set up a recurring 30-minute weekly sync starting January 22.

Other items discussed:
- Budget approval for new audit tools is still pending with Finance
- The annual audit methodology review will happen in February
- Two new team members joining in February need onboarding plans

Rahul will prepare a risk assessment matrix for the APAC reconciliation
issues by end of this week. Li Wei offered to provide data extracts to
support Rahul's analysis.

Next meeting: January 22, 2026 at 3pm HKT.
