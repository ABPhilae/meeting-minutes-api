Quick sync - product team standup jan 20

me, tom, alice, and bob were there. david couldnt make it

tom said the new feature is almost done, maybe by wednesday.
alice is blocked on the API integration, needs bob to finish
the authentication module ASAP. this is critical for the launch.

i mentioned we need to update the docs before release. nobody
volunteered so i guess ill do it myself by friday.

bob said auth module will be done by tomorrow EOD. alice can
start integration on wednesday.

we need to do a demo for stakeholders next monday at 10am.
tom will prepare the demo environment.

next standup: same time tomorrow
